## Topic:
Drivers in revenue for top 1000 movies

## Overview of what we intend to do:
We intend to utilize a dataset from Kaggle that outlines the top 1000 movies by their ranking. We intend to analyze the studio, runtime, and performance by date from both revenue and number of movies that fall within these categories.  

## Three research questions we expect to answer:
1.	We would want to understand the impact that the movie studios have had on sales for top 1000 movies by year? -BG
  •	We would like to see how much revenue each studio is generating in total by creating stacked bar chart with revenue by studio
  •	Per studio, what is their average revenue for movies that fall within the top 1000 list

2.	How has the movie revenue changed based on date? -RL
  •	Is there a better time of year for movie successes? We would like to look at the top 1000 movies and understand if summer blockbusters (June-Aug) fair better than holiday movies (Nov-Jan)
  •	We would like to measure the total revenue by year for movies that are in the top 1000 list

3.	How do movie sales get impacted by the domestic and international market? - MR
  •	Create chart based on revenue by market 

4.	How does rating affect the list of the top 1000 movies - MR
  •	Provide analysis of total counts and revenue by rating

## Hypothesis we intend to test, or regression test we will perform - ZW
We believe that shorter movies will gross more revenue than longer movies that were listed in the top 1000. Our intent is to find the midpoint of run time and understand the revenue associated with those groups. Plotting the times initially to understand the distribution of movies by runtime

## Work Breakdown / Tasks
1.	Find data that support the questions we have and parameters that have been given (8/1/2022)
2.	Review any data that is incomplete any outlier that may skew results (8/2/2022)
3.	Drop or clean data that we find needs adjustments and have loaded for analysis (8/4/2022)
4.	Determine the proper visual per question to tell the story and graph (8/6/2022)
5.	Answer questions and perform analysis with conclusion on the hypothesis (8/7/2022)
6.	Prepare presentation for class (8/8/2022)
