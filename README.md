## Topic:
Drivers in revenue for top 1000 movies

## Overview of what we intend to do:
We intend to utilize a dataset from Kaggle that outlines the top 1000 movies by their ranking. We intend to analyze the studio, runtime, and performance by date from both revenue and number of movies that fall within these categories.  

## Research questions we expect to answer:
1.	How much revenue each studio is generating by studio
2.	Per studio, what is the studios average revenue for movies that fall within the top 1000 list
3.	We would like to look at the top 1000 movies and understand if summer blockbusters (June-Aug) fair better than holiday movies (Nov-Jan)
4.	Which year had the best performance for revenue?
5.	Create chart based on revenue by market
6.	Of the top 1000 grossing movies, what License will the majority fall within? G, PG, PG-13 or R?

## Hypothesis we intend to test, or regression test we will perform
We believe that shorter movies will gross more revenue than longer movies that were listed in the top 1000. Our intent is to find the midpoint of run time and understand the revenue associated with those groups. Plotting the times initially to understand the distribution of movies by runtime
