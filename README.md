## Topic:
Drivers in revenue for top 1000 movies

## Overview of what we intend to do:
We intend to utilize a dataset from Kaggle that outlines the top 1000 movies by their ranking. We intend to analyze the studio, runtime, and performance by date from both revenue and number of movies that fall within these categories.  

## Research questions we expect to answer:
1.	How much revenue has each studio generated?
2.	Per studio, what is the average revenue for movies that fall within the top 1000 list?
3.	Will summer blockbusters (Jun-Aug) fare better than holiday releases (Nov-Jan)?
4.	Which year had the best performance for revenue?
5.	How do movies perform domestically versus internationally?
6.	Of the top 1000 grossing movies, what License will the majority fall within? G, PG, PG-13 or R?

## Hypothesis Test:
We believe that shorter movies will gross more revenue than longer movies that were listed in the top 1000. Using quartile information, we clumped the shortest movies and longest movies into sample groups to test this notion. We ran an independent samples t-test and created various visualizations to paint a clearer picture of our data.
